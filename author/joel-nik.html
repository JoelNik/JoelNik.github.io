<p>A few researchers set out to determine the optimal length of chopsticks for children and adults. They came up with a measure of how effective a pair of chopsticks performed, called the "Food Pinching Performance." The "Food Pinching Performance" was determined by counting the number of peanuts picked and placed in a cup (PPPC).</p>
<h3>An investigation for determining the optimum length of chopsticks.</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15676839">Link to Abstract and Paper</a><br />
<em>the abstract below was adapted from the link</em></p>
<p>Chopsticks are one of the most simple and popular hand tools ever invented by humans, but have not previously been investigated by <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ergonomists">ergonomists</a>. Two laboratory studies were conducted in this research, using a <a href="http://dawg.utk.edu/glossary/whatis_rcbd.htm">randomised complete block design</a>, to evaluate the effects of the length of the chopsticks on the food-serving performance of adults and children. Thirty-one male junior college students and 21 primary school pupils served as subjects for the experiment to test chopsticks lengths of 180, 210, 240, 270, 300, and 330 mm. The results showed that the food-pinching performance was significantly affected by the length of the chopsticks, and that chopsticks of about 240 and 180 mm long were optimal for adults and pupils, respectively. Based on these findings, the researchers suggested that families with children should provide both 240 and 180 mm long chopsticks. In addition, restaurants could provide 210 mm long chopsticks, considering the trade-offs between ergonomics and cost.</p>
<h3>For the rest of this project, answer all questions based only on the part of the experiment analyzing the thirty-one adult male college students.</h3>
<p>Download the <a href="https://www.udacity.com/api/nodes/4576183932/supplemental_media/chopstick-effectivenesscsv/download">data set for the adults</a>, then answer the following questions based on the abstract and the data set.</p>
<p><strong>If you double click on this cell</strong>, you will see the text change so that all of the formatting is removed. This allows you to edit this block of text. This block of text is written using <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Markdown</a>, which is a way to format text using headers, links, italics, and many other options. You will learn more about Markdown later in the Nanodegree Program. Hit shift + enter or shift + return to show the formatted text.</p>
<h4>1. What is the independent variable in the experiment?</h4>
<p>The length of the chopsticks.</p>
<h4>2. What is the dependent variable in the experiment?</h4>
<p>The food pinching performance/efficiency. </p>
<h4>3. How is the dependent variable operationally defined?</h4>
<p>It is the number of peanuts a participant was able to successfully place into a cup.</p>
<h4>4. Based on the description of the experiment and the data set, list at least two variables that you know were controlled.</h4>
<p>Think about the participants who generated the data and what they have in common. You don't need to guess any variables or read the full paper to determine these variables. (For example, it seems plausible that the material of the chopsticks was held constant, but this is not stated in the abstract or data description. Because of this, chopstick length should not be cited as a controlled variable.)</p>
<p>The age and demographics of the study participants.  The time permitted for completing the task (putting peanuts into the cup).  The environment where the experiment was performed. </p>
<p>One great advantage of ipython notebooks is that you can document your data analysis using code, add comments to the code, or even add blocks of text using Markdown. These notebooks allow you to collaborate with others and share your work. For now, let's see some code for doing statistics.</p>

<h4>6. Based on the scatterplot created from the code above, interpret the relationship you see. What do you notice?</h4>
<p>The food pinching effiency appears to peak at 240 mm and decline for both shorter and longer lengths.  The decline appears to be more rapid when increasing chopstick length.  </p>
<p>The rapid drop at 270 mm also stands out.  There might be a reason for the sharp drop, or it might indicate there is signficant variability with the results.  </p>
<h3>In the abstract the researchers stated that their results showed food-pinching performance was significantly affected by the length of the chopsticks, and that chopsticks of about 240 mm long were optimal for adults.</h3>
<h4>7a. Based on the data you have analyzed, do you agree with the claim?</h4>
<p>No. </p>
<h4>7b. Why?</h4>
<p>There are not a enough data points, and without a compelling argument for the the anomalously low value at 270 mm, it seems most likely to be due to normal variability in the results. Since I expect similar variability at other lenghts, it's hard to know whether the apparent improvement would be smaller or even nonexistant in repeated experiments.  </p>
